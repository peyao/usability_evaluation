                While the site packs too much useless information and text in nearly all of its pages, it does a good job of maintaining a consistent color scheme.
                
                <br />
                <br />
                
                The front page doesn't do a terrible job of having the bare essentials, but it could have done without all of the news articles- they're just a bunch of filler words that hardly anyone is going to read. They do a nice job of providing interesting images for all of their links, and emphasize/de-emphasize lots of links using color and fonts. However, they do have MANY links, many of which are useless (the afore mentioned news section being the majority).  As mentioned int he "Match" section, they put too many unrelated links in each dialogue bubble, and I think it ruins the look of each of them. I do appreciate, however, that they have a different color scheme for each bubble; they selected neutral colors for everything below the main tab section on top, so there aren't any glaring clashes.
                
                <br />
                <br />
                
                The news and events section itself is terrible: the sidebar has dated buttons/titles, completely inconsistent with whatever they were trying to do with the header (which is also inconistent in terms of the front page). The sidebar also extends past the list of articles, which baffles me because there are clearly enough articles to go down to the bottom (there are 644 pages worth of them).  The all black background looks tacky, and the white borders separating the header items look like something out of an emo kid's myspace. 
                
                <br />
                <br />
                
                Any page deeper than the front page is extremely wordy, with little to emphasize one item or another. The "Study with us" page, for example, uses large electric blue text to title the various sections- the problem is that nearly everything is in large electric blue text. The other buttons are abnoxious opposing colors like bright green and orange. Nothing lines up (everything seems to be working on its own grid system), and the process they went through to decide what buttons get emphasis is questionable.  This and all of the other sections have an issue with all the words they're trying to squeeze in. The padding would look better if it were larger, and the page would be more apealing if the more important links were better emphasized.
                
                <br />
                <br />
                
                Lastly, many of their pictures and logos are too low-res by today's standards. The photos are fuzzy and unapealing, which is a huge fault in pages like "Research" where the photos play a key role in the presentation of the page.
