-------------
1. Visibility
-------------
Visibility traits:
	1. Location markers (where  on the site am I?)
	2. Separation of sections
	3. Breadcrumbs
	
	Leicester's website initially looks like it has good visibility.
	there are location markers well placed up top, but it seems to
	have some organizational quirks like the section for prospective
	students seems like it would be in the section "Study with Us",
	but it is in the section "Current Students".

--------
2. Match
--------
Match traits:
	1. No confusing words (plain natural language)
	2. Less system oriented terms
	
	Looks good. Very little use of strange terms, except Prospectus,
	but seems like it is a common term for Leicester's main audience.

---------------
3. User Control
---------------
User Control traits:
	1. Going back? Undoing actions?
	2. Breadcrumbs?
	
	Breadcrumbs are located in some pages, but not all of them. This
	shows a lack of user control in those areas. Users would have to
	press the back button on those pages. On the other hand, the
	breadcrumbs don't necessarily take you back to the page you were
	previously either. There are several links to the same page.

-------------------
4. Error Prevention
-------------------
Error Prevention traits:
	1. Error messages
	2. Help users understand what went wrong
	
	Looks pretty good. Form fields handle errors with error messages.
	When applying for the prospectus, it will highlight fields that
	are missing, and for the email field, it will highlight it is not
	an email if you put it random characters.

--------------
5. Consistency
--------------
Consistency traits:
	1. Similar design traits throughout the site
	2. Nav bar shouldn't change all the time
	3. Footer?
	
	The site have large sections that are consistent, and once in awhile
	you get a page that seems to use an older design (A-Z index). The
	footer only changes between the home page and the rest of the pages.

--------------
6. Recognition
--------------
Recognition traits:
	1. Home page
	2. Breadcrumbs
	3. Useful links
	
	The site places its useful links in good locations. It appears they
	attempt to put common actions in useful places. The breadcrumbs are
	also well-placed, above the main content of the page, but under the
	header.

-------------
7. Efficiency
-------------
Efficiency traits:
	1. Get advanced users to where they want quickly
	2. Friendly interface for new users to get where they want quickly
	
	Advanced users have some links in the footer, or they can just use the
	search bars. The advanced users (current students) probably want to
	access Blackboard very often, so they should place the Blackboard link
	near the top, instead of leaving it hidden in the footer. The new users 
	are greeted with several search bars (which may be confusing), and an
	easy to understand sectioning system (Study with Us, Our Research, etc...).

-------------
8. Aesthetics
-------------
Aesthetics traits:
	1. Minimalism
	2. No bloat
	
	The home page looks very good in terms in minimalism and lack of bloat.
	However, once you get deeper where there is a lot of content, you begin
	to wonder if some things are necessary. I believe it is fine for a
	University's website, but there are definitely some useless links in
	some locations.

-----------------
9. Error Recovery
-----------------
Error Recovery traits:
	1. 404 page
	2. Field checking
	
	The 404 page is pretty good. It does a search for your page, in the case
	you tried typing in a link and it couldn't find the page, this would help
	with misspellings. Also it does some link fixing for you (i.e. going to
	../student which doesn't exist transfers you automatically to ../students).
	The prospectus form has an email address field, which checks if users enter
	a syntactically correct email (asdf@hello.com is OK, a#hello.com is NOT OK).
	This will sometimes help, but it probably doesn't see much use as long as
	users aren't messing around. Still a good feature to have and worth it to
	have spent time on it.

--------
10. Help
--------
Help traits:
	1. Where is the link to the Help page located?
	2. Is the Help page useful?
	
	The Help page link is located on the footer of every page. The footer does
	change though, so that may be a downside. The Help page itself is not bad,
	it doesn't have any documentation, just links to pages in case you are lost
	or need a quick link to somewhere you don't remember.
